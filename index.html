      <strong class="title">Hello and Welcome</strong>
      <p>Hi, my name is Ian and this is my blog. Here, I will talk about my game development experiences and share some of my knoeledge.</p>
      <br><p>I stream my proccess on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/ianw3214" target="_blank" class="link">twitch</a> sometimes. There is no official stream schedule yet
        but one will be set up in the near future. Feel free to follow me to catch my streams!</p>
      <br><p>I program mainly in c++ and I am learning Javascript as well. For games I am learning to use the unreal engine, but I may also try other engines
        to see if there is one I like better. I aim to complete every aspect of a game by myself, from art to game design to music.</p>
      <br><p>The main reason I am publishing this blog is because I am finding myself lost in laziness often. I hope that with this blog I can find motivation
        to work through my laziness and finally accomplish something. On top of making games, I also constantly challenge myself with other projects, like working
        through <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer" target="_blank" class="link">daily programming challenges</a> or this blog, which is all coded
        from scratch without the use of any other frameworks.</p>
      <br><p>If there are any improvements you want to see on my blog, please feel free to open an issue on the
        <a href="https://github.com/ianw3214/ianw3214.github.io" target="_blank" class="link">github repositoty</a> for my blog. If you have any suggestions or requests,
        please e-mail me at <u>ianianw21@gmail.com.</u> I hope you enjoy what's to come of this blog, and thanks for reading!</p>
