    <h1 class="title">About Me</h1>
    <p>I was stuck for a while contemplating what to put into my first post, so I figured why not put a short introduction of myself? It was
    then and there that I decided to just do a classic kindergarten introduction: name, age, blah blah blah... Anyways, here goes nothing...</p>
    <br><p>My name is Ian and I am from British Columbia, Canada. I am currently 17 years old and graduating this year, most likely moving
    to Toronto for university. I have loved playing games ever since I was introduced to Pokemon. It started out with pokemon cards, and after
    my dad bought me my first gameboy, I started to become obsessed with it. After a while, my love for pokemon spread to other games as well,
    like Final Fantasy, Maplestory, Mario, and many more. As I grew older, I started playing many more games, ranging from Farmville, Clash
    of Clans, Counter Strike, Guild Wars, League of Legends, Clicker Heroes, Bastion, Minecraft, and many more. Games are such a big and
    important part of my life, which is why I want to become a game developer; I want to pursue my passion.</p>
    <p>I started making games when I was just a little boy, sitting by the dinner table with my pencil and paper, as I slowly drafted my own
    pokemon board game. I would spend hours on it every day and I can still feel the excitement I would get when I played my own game with
    other people. After that, I slowly began to bring my games to school, pretending to be fighting through a dungeon through the hallway with
    all of my friends. As time passed, my attachment to the computer grew. I started playing video games more often, as school started to take
    more and more time out of my life. Before I knew it, I was addicted to online gaming, even spending a good chunk of money on buying in game
    coins and perks.</p>
    <p>It was then and there that my parents intervened, and looking back, I am glad they did. Before I continue with the story, it is important
    to know that both of my parents are software engineers. They were both quite successful back in Taiwan(my home country) and had a lot of
    experience in the field. They decided to start teaching me programming, and boy were they right to do so. I became very eager to learn and
    slowly drifted away from playing games to making them. I started off where any beginner programmer starts, the Hello World Program. I
    was fascinated by the simple program I had made and slowly I began to dwelve deeper into the mystic realm of programming.</p>
    <p>I started off with visual basic, but I quickly made the switch to Java. My mom was teaching me and my friend for a good while before
    we started to take off on our own. I discovered adobe flash and actionscript 3, where I started to make animations and games. Me and my
    friend started a youtube channel for this, called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/FireCowAnimation" target="_blank">Fire Cow</a>.
    This youtube channel is definitely not my best work, but it marks the starting point of my game development journey. I never was able to
    finish any flash game that I created, but it gave me a lot of experience to start off with for some programming concepts.</p>
    <p>I started high school around this time, and I became very involved in our school music program. For the next five years, I would take
    part in the school jazz band. The music program at our school is amazing, there is so much to learn every day and everyone is motivated
    to improve their musicianship. I won the top band student 2012/2013, and from then on our jazz band procceeded to win multiple awards
    from music festivals, whether it was local or international. Although this experience does not relate directly to my game development
    career, I decided it was too important to not include. I have made so many friends through our music program that I normally wouldn't
    have even tried talking to, and it really has opened my eyes to a more beautiful world.</p>

    <p>When I was in about grade 10, I started to become more serious about art. I had always loved drawing, but this time I bought a tablet
    (my mom bough a tablet for me) and I was ready to go pro. After just a few months of practicing, I started doing comissions, my first one
    was just an image for a pitch that earned me $15. That day was the happiest day of my life, because it was the first time in my life where
    I felt like I actually earned something for what I did. Being able to sell my own art was different from any other kind of work/job I had
    done, because it made me feel wanted. I was able to know that people wanted me for my talent and not just my labour, and that is one of the
    best feelings in the world. After that, I recieved a few more commissions, and then I started to look for work to do in the video game
    industry, which was a lot harder than I though.</p>
    <center><img class="img" src="../assets/002_02.jpg" alt="my first comission piece"></center>
    <p>Many artists agree on a code that even as a beginner artist, one must always be payed for their work. I soon realize how much easier it
    is said than done. A lot of this is because many game developers don't have a lot of money, so they like to pick new artists to work for free.
    I was falling into this trap, doing a few commissions without taking any pay, and I soon regretted my own actions. For one, no money means
    less of an incentive to get things done, unless it's a project I'm excited about. Also, I found myself sinking so many hours into the art
    that I was making that no pay just started to seem unfair. This made me realize that without some experience, it was impossible to get a
    paying job, which made it very hard to break into the industry as a new artist. Because of that, I decided to become a solo developer for
    a while and make money by making my own games.</p>
    <p>A lot time has passed now, I started to enter the world of adulthood: getting a girlfriend, getting my drivers license, having my first
    taste of wine(hate it btw), so many more restrictions opened up. The reality hit me though, I needed money. I couldn't live the foolish
    dream of just making games to make money, I had no idea what I was doing and there was no way anyone would play my games. I started to
    play gigs with my combo, and got a part time job for a while(that didn't last long at all). After a few hundred dollars into my bank account,
    the fear of the future started to lurk into my brain. I was going to graduate soon, but I didn't have any advantage over anyone. I needed to
    get a headstart on other people, or else there way I would survive in university, which brings me to the present.</p>
    <p>I started writing this blog for a few reasons.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>I needed to practice my programming skills
      <li>I wanted to get a headstart on the other thousand students who will be in my university class
      <li>I hoped that it would help motivate me to work harder
    </ul>
    <p>I don't know if writing this blog would actually help with any of those things, but it was time to get out of my shell and do something.
    I couldn't just sit around my house and waste my time anymore because somewhere in the world, there is someone working even harder than
    me and I need to work just as hard to keep up. I recently developed a new motto:</p>
    <center><h2>JUST DO IT</h2></center>
    <p>Yes, that is the Shia Labeouf quote, yes it is the Nike quote, but it is a really meaningful phrase. If I hesitate, often times I will
    never end up accomplishing the task that I set out to do. Even one excuse to put something up until later will lead to so many more reasons
    not to do it, until it eventually sinks away into oblivion. When I do things now, I don't think about what I gain, I don't think about what
    the consequences are, I just charge ahead and pray for the best. With that surge of motivation, I started doing so many more things and
    my life has already become so much more colorful. I started pursueing my dream of composing my own music, developing my own IP, <i>
    writing my own blog</i>, and so much more.</p>
    <br><p>So in the end, this was more of a life story than a biography, but I think that works well too. I don't even know if anyone will be
    reading this, but if you are, thank you so much for taking your time to traverse this wall of text. Hopefully my next post will actually
    have something to do with what this blog was meant for, but for the time being, this'll do! I hope you have a good day, and stay tuned for
    my next post!</p>
