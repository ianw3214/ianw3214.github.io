    <p>Hi, my name is Ian and this is my blog. Here, I will talk about my game development experiences and share some of my knowledge.</p>
    <p>The main reason I am publishing this blog is because I am finding myself lost in laziness often. I hope that with this blog I can find motivation
      to work through my laziness and finally accomplish something.</p>
    <p>I hope you enjoy what's to come of this blog, and thanks for reading!</p>
