<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>
    I'm Ian Wang, a third year computer science student at the University of Toronto. As an avid game developer, I'm always trying my best to learn new skills and techniques to improve my craft. 
</p>

<p>
    I started this blog mainly to help myself learn certain concepts better, to practice my writing skills, and to share some of my experiences in gamedev or just programming in general. I will be writing mostly about gamedev topics, but I will also include some general programming posts. I personally love C++, and I'm hoping to make some posts about C++ topics as well. 
</p>

    You can find some of the games I've made on <a href="https://quichi.itch.io/" target="_blank">itch.io</a> or <a href="https://github.com/ianw3214" target="_blank">github</a>. If you have any questions, comments, or suggestions, shoot me a message on <a href="https://twitter.com/ianw3214" target="_blank">twitter</a> or email me at <a href="mailto:ianianw21@gmail.com">ianianw21@gmail.com</a>.
